A simple marquee component with ZERO dependencies for Vue 3. This component was originally developed for internal use but I figured this could be useful to someone else as well. This component is modeled after a React marquee component I found called [React Fast Marquee](https://github.com/justin-chu/react-fast-marquee). To keep a smooth animation running, clones of the content can be created for seamless transitions with no sudden jarring appearences or empty spaces in between content.

# Upgrade to v3.x

If you are using version 1.x or 2.x of `vue3-marquee` you should upgrade to version 3.x. You can do this by running the [Installation](#installation) command below. This adds TS support for the component. There are some new imports so take a look at the [new documentation](https://vue3-marquee.vercel.app/guide.html#usage).

# Installation

If you are using npm:

```shell
npm install vue3-marquee@latest --save
```

If you are using yarn:

```shell
yarn add vue3-marquee@latest
```

# Usage

The most common use case is to register the component globally.

```js
// main.js
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import Vue3Marquee from 'vue3-marquee'
import 'vue3-marquee/dist/style.css'

createApp(App).use(Vue3Marquee).mount('#app')
```

Alternatively you can import the marquee component locally.

```js
import { Vue3Marquee } from 'vue3-marquee'
import 'vue3-marquee/dist/style.css'

export default {
  components: {
    Vue3Marquee,
  },
}
```

You can then use the component in your template. A common use case is an image marquee for logos but you can also use it for scrolling text.

```vue
<template>
  <Vue3Marquee>
    <img height="200" width="300" src="...img" />
    <img height="200" width="300" src="...img" />
    <img height="200" width="300" src="...img" />
  </Vue3Marquee>
</template>

<script>
import { Vue3Marquee } from 'vue3-marquee'
import 'vue3-marquee/dist/style.css'

export default {
  components: {
    Vue3Marquee,
  },
}
</script>
```
